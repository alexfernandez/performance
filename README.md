# performance

A short and slick node.js performance measurement.

## Installation

Simply install with:

    $ npm install performance

and run with:

    $ npm start

You will get a measurement of performance on that particular machine,
which can be compared with other instances.

### Binary

Install globally to get a binary that you can run from any path:

    $ sudo npm install -g performance

And the binary will be called simply performance:

    $ performance

You can run it from any path and with any user.

#### Options

* `--file`: Output results to a file. `performance --file out.txt` is equivalent
  to `performance > out.txt`
* `--json`: Show benchmark results in JSON format
* `--seconds`: Number of seconds to run
* `--version`: Show version number and exit

### Programmatic Use

Once installed, you can use performance from your own packages. Simply require
it, and invoke the function `runBenchmarks()`. It accept an object with the same
options as running it from the CLI:

```
var performance = require('performance');
var results = performance.runBenchmarks();
console.log(results);
```

This will show an object with a lot of results, each with iterations per second and nanoseconds per iteration:

```
{
	nil: {
            seconds: 1.03,
            ips: 1.65844e+8,
            ns: 6,
    },
	...
}
```

## Sample run

On my machine with Node.js v0.10.25: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2120T CPU @ 2.60GHz.

```
$ npm start

> performance@0.0.2 start /home/chenno/projects/performance
> node index.js

It is similar to the performance on a large Amazon AWS instance. Note that most of the time,
what you are paying for on Amazon is more cores, not better ones.

## Some interesting points

Note that a regular `for` loop is more than 20 times faster than `forEach()`,
and that even a `forFun()` function that emulates `forEach()` can easily be made
to run 5 times faster than `forEach()`.

## Extending

Add you own benchmark on `index.js`: simply give it a name and a function
that can be called repeatedly.

    benchmark(name, operation);

Example:

    benchmark('replaceAll()', function()
    {
        return token.replaceAll('=', '').replaceAll('/', '').replaceAll('+', '').toLowerCase();
    });
